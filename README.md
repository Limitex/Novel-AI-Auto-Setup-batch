# Novel-AI-Auto-Setup-batch

Use of this batch file is at your own risk.

This is a batch file that downloads the leaked NovelAI (NAIFU) and automatically sets it up ready for use.
During the setup process, Aria2 is downloaded and Torrent downloaded using it, so the setup may not be completed.

## How to use

Place this batch file in the newly created folder and run it. Also, if there are other files in the same directory, the setup will be interrupted.

The system will check to see if python and pip are available. If they are not, the setup will be interrupted, so please install them as soon as possible.
Make sure you can run `python --version` and `pip --version` in Powershell, etc.
