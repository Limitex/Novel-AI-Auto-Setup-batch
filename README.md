# Novel-AI-Auto-Setup-batch

Use of this batch file is at your own risk.

This is a batch file that downloads the leaked NovelAI (NAIFU) and automatically sets it up ready for use.
During the setup process, Aria2 is downloaded and Torrent downloaded using it, so the setup may not be completed.

## How to use

Place this batch file in the newly created folder and run it. Also, if there are other files in the same directory, the setup will be interrupted.

If the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime is not found during the installation process, the installer will start. Please install and run it again.
If a reboot is required, please reboot and run again.

> Python is now installed in the local Niafu directory, so Python and pip no longer need to be added to the environment variables and run.
